Good morning, you’re listening to Aero Planet FM, and I’m your host, Aero.

Now, picture this — it’s 2027. You’re strolling through the brand-new Bay East Garden at Gardens by the Bay. The air smells faintly of salt and soil, and in front of you, a lush wetland stretches across more than 5,000 square metres. Around you, a hundred mangrove plants sway gently in the breeze — and here’s the beautiful twist — about ten percent of them didn’t grow up here in Singapore. They came from Timor-Leste.

Yes, Timor-Leste — a small nation north of Australia, with rugged mountains, deep blue coasts, and mangrove forests of its own. Among the plants making the journey is the smooth-fruited yellow mangrove — a graceful species that can grow up to ten metres tall, and one that doesn’t exist naturally in Singapore.

Just earlier this month, on October 18, a team from Gardens by the Bay handpicked propagules — those are mangrove seed pods — from an area called Hera, about 12 kilometres from Dili, Timor-Leste’s capital. The next day, those pods were carefully flown to Singapore, where horticulturalists are now nurturing them in a quiet nursery tucked away behind the main gardens. They’ll grow alongside other mangrove species gathered from Pasir Ris Park since July, waiting for the day they’ll take root in their new home at Bay East Garden.

All this is happening thanks to a partnership sealed on October 17 — a memorandum of understanding between Gardens by the Bay and Timor-Leste’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Forestry. The three-year agreement isn’t just about moving plants; it’s about sharing knowledge, training, and promoting public appreciation for biodiversity. Gardens by the Bay will even be lending a hand in developing Timor-Leste’s own botanical garden — the Francisco Xavier do Amaral Garden, a project launched in 2016 that’s now getting new life.

But this collaboration carries a deeper meaning. You see, Timor-Leste, though about 60 percent forested, faces a serious challenge — deforestation. Every year, it loses around 1.7 percent of its forest cover — that’s over 14,000 hectares — to illegal logging, fires, grazing, and slash-and-burn farming. It’s a heavy toll for a young country still finding its balance between development and preservation.

So when those mangroves finally take root here in Singapore, they’ll stand for something bigger — a story of connection. Two nations working hand in hand, exchanging not just plants, but hope — for restoration, for biodiversity, and for a greener future.
